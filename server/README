To ssh into our AWS instance:
Get the pem file I sent you, move it to ~/.ssh or something
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/LAHacks.pem
ssh -i ~/.ssh/LAHacks.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-84-80-92.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Note that the actual instance name ubuntu@ec2-54-84-80-92.compute-1.amazonaws.com is subject to change if we need.
